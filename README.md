This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Python and applying it to various data structures and algorithms. As I progress through my studies, I will be adding new code samples and projects to this repository to document my progress and share what I have learned with others.

=========================================

> The joy of coding Python should be in seeing short, concise,
> readable classes that express a lot of action in a small amount of clear code --
> not in reams of trivial code that bores the reader to death. -[Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum)
